    <h2>Open Letter from the Community</h2>
    
    <div class="vision-text">
      <p>This community was born from a simple yet profound dream: to create a space where exploration and growth are part of daily life, not just fleeting moments. Life here is not about perfection but about authentic living—learning, experimenting, and evolving together. It's a place where we celebrate the process of building something meaningful, knowing that the journey itself is the goal.</p>
      
      <p>This vision is about transforming the way we live, work, and connect. By combining sustainability with curiosity, we aim to create a container that nurtures individuals and the collective alike. It's a living experiment, shaped by those who join us—each person contributing their unique energy to the shared story. Together, we're crafting a new rhythm of life, one that aligns with our values of authenticity, growth, and connection.</p>

      <h3>The Two Roles: Explorer and Supporter</h3>
      <p class="roles-intro">Our community thrives on the principle of shared responsibility. Everyone contributes, though the ways of giving may differ. We've created two roles to reflect this balance:</p>
      
      <div class="roles-grid">
        <div class="role">
          <h4>Explorers</h4>
          <p>These are the curious souls who come to experience community life, join activities, and immerse themselves in the process of exploration. Explorers contribute financially to support the community, allowing them the freedom to focus on discovery and personal growth.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="role">
          <h4>Supporters</h4>
          <p>These are the hands and hearts that help build and sustain the community through work and commitment. Supporters take on practical tasks, projects, or focalized activities that keep the community running and evolving.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="roles-conclusion">Both roles are vital. Whether you're here to explore, support, or both, the contributions come together to create something greater than the sum of its parts—a thriving, dynamic community.</p>
